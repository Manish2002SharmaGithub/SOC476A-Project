**SINGAPOREâ€™S DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION**

Singapore's population has changed a lot over time. In the past, after World War II, birth rates as well as death rates were high in Singapore. But now, both of them are very low. This change happened as Singapore grew quickly in the last 50 years, becoming rich and developing society. Singapore had to plan carefully for its population. They needed enough workers for the economy to grow, but they also had to think about social things like how manyold people there are and how to include people from other countries in the city. This paper talks how the population changed over time and what factors contributed to its change over time.
